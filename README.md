Secure Password Split
A Single-File, Offline-First Progressive Web Application (PWA) for Cryptographic Secret Sharing.
🚨 Security Warning
THIS TOOL IS DESIGNED TO BE RUN LOCALLY AND OFFLINE.
While this application can be hosted on a static server (like GitHub Pages), for maximum security, it is highly recommended to:
	1	Download the SPSS.html file (index.html in the repo).
	2	Disconnect your device from the internet.
	3	Run the file locally in a trusted browser.
	4	Close the browser window before reconnecting to the network.
📖 Overview
Secure Password Split is a client-side utility that allows you to split sensitive secrets (passwords, seed phrases, private keys) into multiple shares using information-theory cryptographic security methods. It operates entirely in the browser with zero server-side transmission.
It supports two splitting modes:
	1	N-of-N (XOR): All generated shares are required to reconstruct the secret.
	2	K-of-N (Threshold Cryptography): Uses Shamir's Secret Sharing (over GF(256)). A subset (K) of the total shares (N) is required to reconstruct the secret.
✨ Features
Cryptography
	•	CSPRNG: Uses window.crypto.getRandomValues for all random number generation.
	•	Transport Agnostic: Shares are encoded in Hexadecimal, making them safe to transport via any medium (paper, email, text) regardless of the secret's original character set.
	•	Sanitized Reconstruction: Automatically handles case sensitivity and whitespace cleaning during reconstruction.
Application Architecture
	•	Single File Interface (SFI): The entire app (HTML, CSS, JS, SVG Assets, PWA Manifest, Service Worker) is contained in one .html file.
	•	Recursive Quine Download: The application can download its own source code directly from memory, ensuring the offline copy is an exact replica of the running instance.
	•	PWA Support: Fully installable on iOS, Android, and Desktop (Chrome/Edge). Includes an embedded Service Worker for offline caching.
UI/UX
	•	Secure Inputs: autocomplete="off" and anti-password-manager attributes (data-lpignore) to prevent unauthorized caching.
	•	Visual Hashing: "Hold to Reveal" functionality with syntax highlighting (Red for digits, Green for symbols) to aid in manual transcription verification.
	•	Dark/Light Mode: Auto-detection with manual override.
	•	Generator: Built-in secure password generator with configurable complexity (Symbols, Case, Numbers).

Offline (Recommended)
	1	Click the HERE link in the top yellow banner to download the SPSS.html.
	2	Open the file in your preferred browser.
	3	To Split:
	•	Enter your secret.
	•	Select Split or Threshold Split.
	•	Adjust the sliders/inputs for the number of shares (N) and threshold (K).
	•	Click SPLIT.
	•	Copy the resulting Hex strings.
	4	To Reconstruct:
	•	Go to the Reconstruct tab.
	•	Paste your Hex shares.
	•	If using Shamir shares, toggle "Use Threshold Mode" to ON.
	•	Click RECONSTRUCT.
